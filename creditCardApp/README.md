# creditCardApp
This is my credit card checker app which was originally built using my own algorithm courtesy of Luhn's algorithm, you can see more here: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/order-management-sw/9.3.0?topic=cpms-handling-credit-cards https://www.freeformatter.com/credit-card-number-generator-validator.html

Luhn's algorithm is used globally to validate a bank card. In this project I have taken that approach to iterate through an input to determine whether it is a valid card or not. Based on the input, the console will log whether it is valid or not, as well as the type of card and you will also see the background change from grey to green, or to red if it isn't valid.

To build the layout I used flexbox and a pretty standard layout when it came to the form and input box. The button is a standard button.

The palette I used is from: https://coolors.co/palettes/trending
